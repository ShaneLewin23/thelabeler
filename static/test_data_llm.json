	'model': 'chatgpt_3.5',
	'response': 'Oligonucleotide therapies are a rapidly evolving area in cancer treatment, offering potential advantages such as specificity and reduced side effects. Here are some promising oligonucleotide therapies targeting cancer:

Antisense Oligonucleotides (ASOs): ASOs are designed to bind complementary mRNA, inhibiting translation or promoting degradation of specific target mRNA molecules involved in cancer growth or progression. For example, ASOs targeting oncogenes like Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL are being explored for various cancers.
siRNA (Small Interfering RNA) Therapies: siRNA molecules can silence gene expression by targeting mRNA molecules for degradation, thus inhibiting the production of specific proteins involved in cancer cell survival or proliferation. Therapies targeting genes like KRAS or MYC are in development for multiple cancer types.
miRNA (MicroRNA) Therapies: miRNAs are small non-coding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression. Dysregulation of miRNAs is implicated in cancer development and progression. Therapies aiming to restore or inhibit specific miRNAs hold promise for cancer treatment. For instance, miR-34 mimics are being investigated for their tumor-suppressive effects.
RNAi (RNA Interference) Nanotherapeutics: RNAi-based nanoparticles can deliver siRNAs or miRNAs to target cancer cells specifically, minimizing off-target effects. These nanoparticles can be engineered for targeted delivery and controlled release of therapeutic oligonucleotides.
Antisense Oligonucleotide-Drug Conjugates: Conjugating ASOs with cytotoxic agents or other therapeutic molecules allows for targeted delivery to cancer cells, enhancing therapeutic efficacy while minimizing systemic toxicity. This approach is being explored in various preclinical and clinical studies for different cancer types.
Splice-Switching Oligonucleotides: Splice-switching oligonucleotides can modulate pre-mRNA splicing, leading to alternative splicing patterns that may disrupt cancer cell survival pathways or restore normal cellular functions. This approach holds potential for targeting specific mutations or aberrant splicing events in cancer.
Immunomodulatory Oligonucleotides: Oligonucleotides can also be designed to modulate immune responses against cancer cells. For example, Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists or immune checkpoint inhibitors delivered as oligonucleotide therapeutics can enhance anti-tumor immune responses and improve the efficacy of immunotherapy.
These are just a few examples of the diverse approaches being explored in the field of oligonucleotide therapeutics for cancer treatment. While many of these strategies are still in preclinical or early clinical stages, they hold significant promise for improving cancer treatment outcomes in the future.'
